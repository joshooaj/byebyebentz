### Epstein Files Transparency Refusal
- **Date**: September 8, 2025
- **Action**: Refused to commit to signing Epstein Files Transparency Act (H.R. 4405)
- **Exact Quote**: "I'm working with Chairman Comer and his ongoing investigation rather than just demanding files be released that might compromise ongoing investigations... I think it's much more important to work with Chairman Comer than it is to sign onto a bill that might very well compromise ongoing investigations."
- **Source**: Town Hall transcript, lines 340-380
- **Analysis**: Standard political excuse to avoid transparency - "ongoing investigations" claim without evidence
- **Pattern**: Shows preference for party leadership over constituent demands for accountability

  - [Later] "The gas tax is going to go up and many of the fees that surround the gas tax are going to go up... people are going to be unhappy that this bill increases their costs"
- **Source**: Town Hall transcript, lines 720-750 and 850-890
- **Contradiction**: Claims federal policies help "working families" while admitting state policies make basic necessities unaffordable for same families
- **Pattern**: Speaking out of both sides of his mouth on economic relief

### Oregon Transportation Cost Deflection
- **Date**: September 8, 2025

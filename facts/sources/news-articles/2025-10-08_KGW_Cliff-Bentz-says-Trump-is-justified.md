# Rep. Cliff Bentz says Trump is justified in calling National Guard to Portland, talks government shutdown

PORTLAND, Ore. — Rep. Cliff Bentz says President Donald Trump is justified in his push to send federal troops to protect Portland's ICE building on the South Waterfront, criticizing the Portland Police Bureau for a lack of enforcement in the surrounding area.

"The president had little choice when it came to calling up the National Guard because local law enforcement is incapable of protecting the people that are trying to carry out the federal work of immigration and control," Bentz said Wednesday in an interview with KGW.

Bentz, Oregon's only Republican member of Congress, who represents much of Eastern Oregon, said PPB should've cleared the area around the ICE building well before DHS Secretary Kristi Noem arrived on Tuesday.

"They should be putting up barriers, protecting ingress and egress to that building, and they should be setting up perhaps a free speech zone some distance away," Bentz said. "And they should be trying to protect and enforce the noise ordinance that kicks in around 11 at night."

PPB is drastically underfunded, Bentz said, and he's frustrated that the city hasn't done more to make sure federal immigration workers are not impeded from doing their job.

He said many of his constituents in the eastern half of Oregon carry a negative perception about Portland, though he said he has pushed back in recent years.

"Their attitude is that it's still a city in ruins, a city in shambles, a city that is lawless and filled with people on drugs and tents wherever you try to park — that's very said. I also think that's mainly wrong," Bentz said. "It's getting better. I try to tell people that when they talk about Portland; I go, 'It's not that way anymore.'"

Working from his office in Ontario, Bentz said there is little progress at the federal level as the government shutdown enters its second week.

"What [staffers are] telling me is that nothing is happening, like nothing," he said. "That does not bode well for this ending anytime soon, and that's bad news for America."

Democrats are refusing to agree to Republicans' proposed funding plan for the federal government — saying many people could lose health insurance coverage or see their premiums become unaffordable.

“Oregonians are going to be hurt by the projected 68% increase when they sign back up for insurance in November," said Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, when discussing the shutdown.

Bentz argued that Democrats need to 'step up,' saying the holdout is ineffective governance

“If they want to discuss a complicated matter like [healthcare], then reopen the government so we can have those discussions without holding the military hostage, without holding the [air] traffic control folks hostage," he said.

He pointed to the current federal funding plan, a temporary measure that would only last until Nov. 21. 

Bentz said Democrats could agree to a continuing resolution, focus on healthcare for the next month and a half, and then force another government shutdown if they didn't get results they liked — a plan Bentz said was a better alternative to the current shutdown.

### Content Strategy

The image should immediately communicate:
1. **Accountability message** - This is about holding an elected official responsible

### Creation Tools

Can be created with:

2. Add text overlay with the key messaging
3. Ensure proper contrast for text readability
4. Include the website branding

### Testing

After creation, test the image by:
1. Using Facebook's Open Graph debugger
2. Using Twitter's Card Validator
3. Checking how it appears at different sizes
4. Verifying text remains readable when scaled down
